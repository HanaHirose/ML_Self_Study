Welcome to ML_Self_Study! This repository is dedicated to my self-directed learning in machine learning. Here, I explore and implement various ML algorithms to deepen my understanding and enhance my skills. I will be continuously updating this repository with new implementations as I progress in my studies.


## Algorithms

- Regression

etc...

## Frameworks

**scikit-learn**: [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a powerful Python module for machine learning that provides tools for data mining and data analysis. I use scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models.

## Data Science Tools

**Google Colab**

**Jupyter Notebook**
